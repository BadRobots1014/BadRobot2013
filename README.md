FRC Team 1014 Robot Source

To use this code, first install the FRC plugin for Eclipse or Netbeans. Then create a new project based off of the Command Based Robot template. Delete all the source packages and then clone/pull this code into the project. All of the other files will be generated by the IDE upon build. 

This code is meant ONLY to be deployed onto a cRIO robot meant for FRC games. It is provided for free and open source as to allow the collaboration and additional development that will grow the project. 

The code may be (will be) buggy and isn't guaranteed to be fully functional in any capacity. Any questions or concerns should be directed towards the lead developer of it: jonbuckley33. In addition of contact through github, you can reach him by emailing him at jonbuckley33@gmail.com

v1.0 -- code builds, deploys, and runs successfully on v47 cRIOs.
