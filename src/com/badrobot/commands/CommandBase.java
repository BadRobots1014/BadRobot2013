/**
 * The base for all commands. All atomic commands should subclass CommandBase.
 * CommandBase creates and stores each control system. To access a
 * subsystem elsewhere in your code in your code use CommandBase.exampleSubsystem
 * 
 * EXPLANATION: Whats up with this class? - Well here goes, using a CommandBase 
 * system is very useful when programming. The big benefit is that it allows 
 * programmers to build up code without a physical robot. It also centralizes
 * the access to hardware components (ie Drive Train or Shooter). 
 * ---CommandBase is extended BY Commands (ie DriveWithJoystick)---
